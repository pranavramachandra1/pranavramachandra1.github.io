Hi, I'm a **software engineer** who just graduated from **UC Berkeley** majoring **Chemical Engineering** with a minor in **Data Science**.

A little bit about me: I am a passionate builder eager to find my next big project to work on. My internship experiences include applied engineering, backend, and machine learning experiences at companies such as Telsa, Chevron, and QuantumScape. Some of the areas I am interested in include computer vision, deep learning, and AI agents.

Outside of my career, I love **weightlifting, running, hiking**, and pretty much anything outdoors. I am a huge **Chicago Bulls** fan, and a hopeful Bears fan. I am also an **amateur DJ** (please feel free to checkout my mixes under [chia p](https://soundcloud.com/pranav-ramachandra))!

I am always happy to chat! Please feel free to shoot me an email at pranavramachandra@berkeley.edu, or a [LinkedIn DM](https://linkedin.com/in/pranavramachandra).
