Hi, I'm a **senior** at **UC Berkeley** studying **Data Science & Chemical Engineering**.

My interests lie within **deep learning, statistics, and app development**. I have strong interests in building deep learning models that have applications in engineering related fields. Some areas of interest to be are **computational chemistry, materials discovery, and computer vision applications**. I am passionate about projects that yield something useful to the world; specifically projects that are focused on improving environmental sustainability are interesting to me!

I've spent a lot of time as an engineer and experimentalist, and I've also found a strong passion in software engineering. My engineering internship experiences include process engineering at Chevron, and cell engineering & data science at Tesla. I've also spent 3 years studying liquid-state lithium ion batteries in the McCloskey Group on various projects and my own.

**I recently finished a software engineering internship at Quantumscape**, where I was working on tools for engineers to interface with their data. I also developed a deep learning model that predicts the number of cycles a cell will last based on time series electrical data, and working on detecting hardward anomalies using image transformations of electrical signal data. 

Outside of my career, I love **weightlifting, running, hiking**, and pretty much anything outdoors. I am a huge **Chicago Bulls** fan, and a hopeful Bears fan. I am also an **amateur DJ** (please feel free to checkout my mixes under [chia p](https://soundcloud.com/pranav-ramachandra))!
